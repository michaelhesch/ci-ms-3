### Code Validation

The W3C Markup Validator, W3C CSS Validator, PEP8 Online and PyCharm were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no outstanding syntax errors in the project.  Results of those checks are documented in PDFs included in the project repository and can be accessed by following the links below.

- [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/)
  - As the majority of the functionality of the site requires a user to be logged in, testing HTML via the deployed site was not possible, outside of the index page, login page and register page.  All return no errors except for Register, which contains an error due to Flask WTForms rendering a label with a "for" attribute for a radio button field, which is not understood to be a valid input field by the validator.  There is no way to change this rendering configuration that I am aware of after investigation and review of the WTForms documentation.
  - When validating directly via HTML code, due to the use of the Jinja templating language each HTML file will produce warnings and errors in the W3C Markup validator.  However, every page on the site was checked by inserting its respective code into the base.html template directly in the W3C validator, and the warnings/errors returned for each page were reviewed to ensure only Jinja related errors were returned.
  - Upon review of each page, no outside errors remain in the project that are not due to Jinja templating syntax.

- [W3C CSS Validator - Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
  - [Style.css Results](documentation/validation/MS3-CSS-Validation.pdf)
    - No warnings or errors returned when validating style.css content directly.
    - Note: multiple warnings are returned if validation is run on the deployed app due to dependencies such as Bootstrap.

- [JSHint](https://jshint.com/)
  - This project uses limited custom JavaScript, but does rely on external JS such as Masonry and ImagesLoaded to function correctly.  The internal JavaScript passed the JSHint linter with no errors, but did return two warnings as it was unable to identify the external packages referenced in the code (Masonry and ImagesLoaded) that are loaded outside of the code tested JS block.

- [PEP8 Online](http://pep8online.com/) - PEP8 Online is a web-based PEP8 code format compliance checker which was used to check each Python file in this app for PEP8 compliance.
  - Warnings returned for the app sub-package "__init__.py" files due to the need to import the routes package at the bottom of the file rather than the top, after the package blueprint is created.  Without this configuration the app will not work as it is not able to initialize any of the routes which depend upon the respective blueprints.  PyCharm does not produce any error or warning for this configuration.

- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) - Pycharm Python IDE was used as an additional double-check on all Python code for PEP8 compliance after checking each file with PEP8 Online.
  
#### Functional Testing

- Below are descriptions of tests undertaken on the deployed project to ensure expected behaviors of functionality.

- Registration
  - PASSING: E-Mail Address Validation - Form correctly requires a valid email address to be entered in the email field.
  - PASSING: Password Match Validation - Form correctly requires passwords entered by the user to match.
  - PASSING: Empty Form Submission Validation - Form does not proceed with posting if required fields are blank.  Tested fields username, first name, last name, and password fields.  Avatar color is pre-selected by default and cannot be de-selected before submitting.
  - PASSING: Duplicate Email Cannot Register - Form correctly prevents a user from registering a new account using an email address that is already currently in the database.
  - PASSING: Default Avatar Selected - By default the form is populated with an avatar colour selected, which can be changed by the user but cannot be de-selected entirely, which is the intended behavior.
  - PASSING: Username Regex Validation - Usernames cannot contain spaces or special characters, only upper or lower case letters and numbers.  Confirmed multiple combinations of special characters and spaces in username field are returned as invalid by the form.

- Login
  - PASSING: Username Does Not Exist Validation - Form endpoint will catch mongoengine error response for a username that does not exist in the database and return a flash message to the user indicating the credentials are incorrect, but intentionally does not specify between the username or password being incorrect.  Correct login credentials are validated and result in a successful login.
  - PASSING: Incorrect Password Validation - Password validation functionality works correctly resulting in an incorrect login details flash message to the user.  This intentionally does not specify if the username or password is incorrect.

- Add Photo
  - OPEN: Description max length validation - Form validation from WTForms is not validating input length, despite being configured for validation in the form model.  Passing 'maxlength' to the necessary fields consistent with the validator length limits to ensure these field limits are adhered to.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

#### First Time Visitor Story Testing

> I want to understand the service the website provides before registering.

- The initial landing page contains a large info card with a clear description of the goal of the site, and directs the user to the registration page.

> I want to create a new user account and be able to log in.

- The initial landing page contains a call-to-action button directing users to either the log in or registration pages depending on their needs.  In addition the navigation bar contains these same links.

> I want to easily interact with content posted by other users on the site by adding 'likes' or comments.

- After completing a very quick registration or log-in process, users are immediately greeted with the main content of the platform, the photo feed.  From here they can click into photos they may be interested in or continue through additional pages of photos.

> I want to easily add my own photos to the platform for other users to interact with.

- Once logged in users can access the photo upload form directly from the navigation bar, or from a button on their profile page.  Adding a photo requires only a title and brief description before uploading.

#### Returning Visitor Story Testing

> I want to easily log in to my account and access my profile.

- The site will keep a user session active for 12 hours if they do not log out explicitly, allowing them to immediately resume interacting with the platform if they return in this time.  Otherwise, if a session has expired they will be directed to the log in page immediately upon return.

> I want to be able to quickly access and explore the main photo feed content.

- The Explore feed is directly accessible from the menu bar from any location within the site once a user is logged in.

> I want to be able to manage the content I add to the platform - including editing or deleting my photos, comments and likes.

- Content that a user adds to the platform will display additional controls not visible on other user's photos and comments, giving them the ability to edit and/or delete photos or comments they no longer wish to keep online.  In addition any photo or comment a user 'likes' can be 'un-liked' by simply clicking the like button again.

#### Site Owner Story Testing

> I want to provide a streamlined registration and login experience.

- The user registration form contains only basic details about the user, and should easily fit on most screens without any scrolling required, allowing for fast and easy registration.  User's who register are then logged in automatically without any additional steps required.  For existing users, to log in they must simply enter their username and password and they will then be directed to the Explore feed.
  
> I want to provide a fun and interactive experience for the user.

- The Explore photo feed is organized by most liked photos first, then most recently uploaded, so there should be new content for users to view each time they visit the platform.  In addition, they can leave a 'like' or comment on any photo on the platform, providing many opportunities for engaging with content.

> I want to encourage the user to return back to the platform to see and interact with new content.

- The ability for users to keep adding new photos and getting feedback from other users on the platform creates incentive to check the platform regularly.  In addition, the Explore feed content should provide new content for a returning user to see based on the level of activity since they last visited.

> I want to allow users to manage their content - adding, editing and deleting as they desire.

- User's can easily add new photos or view all of their uploaded photos in their profile view, allowing them to quickly review the content they have posted.  Users can also click into any of these photos to edit attributes, edit or delete comments they have posted to a given photo, or delete the photo if they choose.

### Responsiveness

- All pages were tested for responsiveness and any visible bugs using Google Chrome developer tools to emulate the viewing size across all standard device sizes offered.  Media queries have been implemented in the CSS of the site to adjust various attributes as necessary to improve the viewing experience on small screen sizes, such as scaling social media icon sizes and adjusting button styling to remain easily usable.  In addition site rendering on very high resolutions (such as "4K" or 2160p) were checked to ensure consistent performance as expected.
  
  Device Screen Sizes Tested:

  ![Device Sizes Tested](screenshots/device-list.png)

- In addition, all pages on the site were tested for correct behavior on a 27" desktop monitor, a 15.1" laptop monitor, an iPhone 11 and a 10.5" iPad Pro.  The pages scale and respond as expected for a normal user experience across these viewing sizes & devices.

### Lighthouse

- The Lighthouse tool within Chrome Developer tools was used to generate performance scores and identify areas for improvement in both mobile and desktop views of the page.  Lighthouse scoring was performed on the photo Explore page, as this is the most resource intensive page in the app.  Results of this scoring can be viewed via the links below:
  
  1. [Mobile Score & Summary](documentation/lighthouse/Explore-Mobile.pdf)

  2. [Desktop Score & Summary](documentation/lighthouse/Explore-Desktop.pdf)

    ![Desktop Lighthouse Results](screenshots/Desktop-LH.PNG)

- Please note that while efforts to correct some defects indicated in these results are due to issues found in external dependencies, such as MDBootstrap's CSS for example, or other faults that are beyond the scope of this project to remedy.

### Noteworthy Issues & Bugs Encountered in Development

- [Resolved] "None" response from WTForms process_data()
- An important component of the user experience for the site is pre-populating edit fields with the existing data, so that when a user clicks 'edit', they are able to see the values they have already entered.  This applies to photo descriptions and comments in particular.
  - When attempting to render the edit modal for these features, WTForms would not return any existing value, despite multiple approaches to apply the existing database values to the form fields.  
  - A solution was found using a WTForms method called process_data(), which is passed a data object as its only argument, that resulted in existing form data rendering in the form correctly.  This method was applied in the Jinja template code for the form fields - both a StringField input field a TextAreaField textarea.
  - When using this approach, for reasons still unknown, process_data() returned an additional value of " None ", which was injected in-between the label field and the input field below.  Hours of troubleshooting and discussion with my mentor did not result in a solution, so a work-around was crafted.
  - This problem was solved by setting up the necessary input fields in HTML directly, and setting the default values using Jinja to access the existing data values.

- [Resolved] Masonry layout rendering

- When implementing the Masonry layout, using the Masonry JS plugin compatible with MDB / Bootstrap v5, a serious rendering issue was encountered on initial loading of a photo page.
- Due to the Masonry layout being applied to the div structure before the image files were fully loaded, the image cards would render stacked to the top of the viewable area, and overlapping each other.  Refreshing the page would result in the correct layout rendering, as Masonry could correctly set the size attributes of the divs with the image files loaded.
- After extensive investigation, a solution was found using JavaScript to initialize Masonry after all page content was loaded, so that the layout will be applied correctly every time the page is viewed.
- This solution is credited to [this codepen example](https://codepen.io/desandro/pen/MwJoZQ) and was adapted for use in this project.

- [Open] "Back" button navigation after 'like'

- When a user views a photo then presses the 'like' button, to either add or remove a 'like', when they then press the back button in the browser, the page does not navigate back.  This behavior likely has to do with how the endpoint is being called to perform the like/un-like functions, which results in the current photo being re-rendered.  The database is being updated correctly in this instance but this is not an ideal user experience in its current state.

- [Open] Ongoing WTForms validation issues

- As mentioned previously in the testing section above, several forms are not validating correctly for some reason.  This seems to be isolated to value length limits specified in the form models that are not being enforced in the UI.  No data is being passed to the database that exceeds the character limits, but no form error message is being returned to the user to indicate they have violated a form requirement.  The current work-around solution to this is to pass the maxlength="x" parameter to the necessary form fields via their Jinja template code, which does work in preventing a user from exceeding the specified limit before submitting a form.  Additional investigation is needed to identify why these forms are behaving this way, while others such as Log In and Register are validating correctly.
